## instructions for GitHub-Colab integration and versioning
this repository can be dinamically linked and run in Google Colab, how?
1. after the user get access to this repository as editor
2. he can open a selected notebook version on branch directly from Google Colab in file > open notebook > GitHub
3. *after* he created a branch in GitHub, he can save a new edited Colab notebook in the new branch
4. Main branch is then merged via pull requests via Git UI

when preferred, the user can use any local IDE for development and push the local notebook to a branch of this repository
that can be accessed via Colab as explained in point 2.
*N.B.:* the code for data reading will be different in local environment and Google Colab -> the user need to create a new cell and comment the other one when not used
